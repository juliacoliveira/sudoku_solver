# sudoku_solver

This code was made using as parameter the code of George Seif that I saw at: https://medium.com/@george.seif94/solving-sudoku-using-a-simple-search-algorithm-3ac44857fee8
With just some additional things and my comments. 
In this code you'll need to put the matrix you want at the txt file, with zeros occupying the blank spaces. If you have some problem by running this code, please try to change the path of the file in the lines: 21 and 146.
