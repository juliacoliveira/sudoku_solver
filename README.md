# sudoku_solver

This code was made using as parameter the code of George Seif that i saw at: https://medium.com/@george.seif94/solving-sudoku-using-a-simple-search-algorithm-3ac44857fee8
With just some additional things and my comments. 
In this code you'll need to put the matrix you want at the txt file, with zeros occupying the blank spaces; 
and you'll have to change the path of the file according to your's.
